# period

This is a simple command line tool to calculate the next period of a woman.

## how it works

The program will ask to enter the name of the user who wants to calculate the next period, the date when the last period started and the usual length of the cycle period of the user.

The program will give three different outputs:

* If the next period date is in the future it'll return the date.
* if the next period date is in the past, but with 5 days of tolerance, it'll return an alert with a date when to get a pregnancy test.
* if the next period date is in the past and the tolerance period is over, it'll suggest to get a pregnancy test or to go to a gynecologist.
